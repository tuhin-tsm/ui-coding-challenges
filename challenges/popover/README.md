## What is popover

A popover is a transient view that shows on a content screen when a user clicks on a control button or within a defined area.

Designing a popover typically involves considering several requirements to ensure it is functional, user-friendly, and integrates well into the existing application. Here are the typical requirements for designing a popover:

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Trigger Mechanism**:

   - **Event Type**: The popover should be triggered by an event, such as a click, hover, or focus on a specific element.
   - **Element**: Specify which element(s) will trigger the popover.

2. **Content**:

   - **Dynamic vs. Static**: Determine if the content within the popover is static (predefined) or dynamic (fetched from an API or changes based on context).
   - **Type**: The content could be text, images, forms, or interactive elements.

3. **Positioning**:

   - **Placement**: Define the position of the popover relative to the trigger element (e.g., top, bottom, left, right).
   - **Responsive**: Ensure the popover adjusts its position or size based on the viewport size to stay visible.

4. **Styling**:

   - **Design Consistency**: The popover should match the overall design language of the application (colors, fonts, shadows).
   - **Transitions**: Smooth transition effects for showing and hiding the popover.

5. **Behavior**:

   - **Close Mechanism**: How the popover can be dismissed (e.g., clicking outside, clicking a close button, pressing the ESC key).
   - **Repositioning**: Handle repositioning if the viewport changes (e.g., window resize).

6. **Accessibility**:
   - **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure the popover can be navigated using the keyboard.
   - **Aria Attributes**: Properly set ARIA attributes to describe the popover to screen readers.

### Non-functional Requirements:

1. **Performance**:

   - Ensure the popover renders efficiently and does not impact the performance of the page.

2. **Usability**:

   - The popover should be intuitive to use and not obstruct other important UI elements.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:

   - The popover should work consistently across different browsers.

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests to verify the functionality.
   - End-to-end tests to ensure it works correctly in user flows.

### Example Scenario:

Imagine you are asked to design a popover for a web application. The popover is intended to display additional details when a user hovers over an information icon next to a form field. The content should be dynamic, fetched from a server, and include both text and links. The popover should appear above the icon and have a close button, but it should also close if the user clicks outside of it.

These requirements should give you a clear picture of what needs to be considered when designing a popover for a front-end application.
